# GarbageImagesClassificationSystem
A garbage image classification model to segregate waste using transfer learning and Keras.

## Description

Inspiration: https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1755-1315/775/1/012010<br>

This project, a garbage image classification program, was fueled by my deep love for the environment and my desire to enhance my deep learning and Tensorflow skills. Drawing inspiration from the devastating impact of both children and adults dispoing of waste in the incorrect bins, I dedicated myself to training a model that could accurately identify and categorize different types of garbage items through images. Through countless hours of refining the model's architecture and learning/reading about transfer learning and Keras, I achieved a high accuracy level (~96%).

Data from Kaggle.

However, there is always room for improvement. I've already left a few thoughts at the end of the journal on how I can further enhance this project. However, I hope to incorporate this software into some hardware to help fight the good fight! 

Please reach out if you would like to learn more or help out!

## Getting Started 
Simply download the Jupyter Notebook and data. Originally, this project was completed via AWS SageMaker and S3. However, I transfered it to  a local Jupyter Notebook. If you'd like to see the Notebook on SageMaker, please reach out!

Reach out if you have any suggestions to improve my methodology/code. I'm grateful for any learning opportunity!
